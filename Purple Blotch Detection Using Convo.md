**Introduction**

Manual identification of crop diseases is proactive but often inefficient. This project leverages CNNs—a class of deep neural networks designed for object detection and image classification—to automate the detection of diseased areas on crop leaves. By utilizing annotated datasets, the model learns to accurately distinguish between healthy leaves and those with purple blotch lesions.



**Existing System**

Traditionally, detection relies on manual inspection by agricultural experts.

**• Limitations:** Time-consuming, labor-intensive, prone to human error, and lacks scalability for large agricultural fields.



**Proposed System**

An automated detection system based on CNNs and YOLOv8.

**• Improvements:** Achieves high accuracy, minimizes misdiagnosis, and enables real-time monitoring of crops.

Key Features

**• Automation:** Eliminates the need for manual inspection.

**• Scalability:** Can be deployed across large agricultural fields for comprehensive monitoring.

**• Adaptability:** The system can be adjusted to detect other diseases in various crops.

**• Efficiency:** Enables farmers to implement targeted management strategies quickly.



**System Architecture**

The system follows a standard CNN pipeline for image processing:

**1. Input Image:** High-resolution leaf images.

**2. Processing Layers:** Multiple stages of Convolution + ReLU and Pooling to extract features.

**3. Classification:** Full convolution and Softmax layers to generate labels (Diseased vs. Healthy).



**Methodology**

**Data Collection and Preprocessing**

**• Sources:** Agricultural research databases and field surveys.

**• Annotation:** Domain experts used bounding boxes to precisely label purple blotch lesions.

**• Preprocessing:** Images were resized, pixel values were normalized, and data augmentation (rotation, flipping, brightness adjustments) was applied to reduce overfitting.



**Model Selection and Setup**

**• Architecture:** YOLOv8 was selected for its real-time inference capabilities and high accuracy.

**• Framework:** PyTorch.

**• Transfer Learning:** Initialized with pre-trained weights from the COCO dataset to expedite convergence.



**Training the YOLOv8 Model**

The dataset was split into:

**• Training:** 70%.

**• Validation:** 15% (used for hyperparameter tuning).

**• Testing:** 15% (used for final evaluation). Training utilized Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum and a scheduled learning rate.



**Project Timeline**

The project was executed following a structured progression:

**1. Phase 1: Research \& Literature Survey -** Analyzing existing deep learning solutions for plant disease detection.

**2. Phase 2: Data Collection -** Gathering images via field surveys and databases.

**3. Phase 3: Annotation \& Preprocessing -** Labeling lesions with normalized coordinates and applying augmentation.

**4. Phase 4: Model Selection \& Training -** Configuring YOLOv8 and training on the 70/15/15 split.

**5. Phase 5: Evaluation \& Validation -** Testing the model on unseen data and real-world field images.



**Evaluation and Results**

The model’s performance was quantified using:

**• Metrics:** Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

**• Robustness:** The model demonstrated the ability to generalize to images captured under varying lighting and environmental conditions in onion fields.

**• Visual Validation:** Successful identification of "purpleBlotch" lesions was confirmed through bounding box predictions on test images.



**Conclusion and Future Enhancements**

The study successfully developed a robust system for the early detection of purple blotch disease.



**Future Enhancements**

**• Dataset Expansion:** Continuous augmentation with diverse images to improve generalization.
